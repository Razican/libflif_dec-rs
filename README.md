[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Razican/libflif_dec-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Razican/libflif_dec-rs) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Razican/libflif_dec-rs/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Razican/libflif_dec-rs?branch=master)

This is an interface to the FLIF reference implementation decode library. FLIF
is the acronym for Free Lossless Image Format. A new image compression algorithm
that allows for better compression ratios than those of PNG, JPEG or WebP while
